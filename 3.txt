Political declaration of the high-level meeting to review progress made in addressing the priorities of small island developing States through the implementation of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway

2. We reaffirm that the Samoa Pathway is a stand-alone, overarching framework setting out the sustainable development priorities of small island developing States that builds on the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. 3 The Samoa Pathway is consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development,5 and is in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015­2030,6 the New Urban Agenda7 and the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.8
3. We recognize and welcome the ownership, leadership and considerable efforts that have been demonstrated by small island developing States, with the support of the international community, in advancing the implementation of the Samoa Pathway, and welcome the successes and the progress made to date.
4. We reaffirm that small island developing States remain a special case for sustainable development and we renew our solidarity with them, as they continue to face the combined challenges arising, in particular, from their geographical remoteness, the small scale of their economies, high costs and the adverse effects of climate change and natural disasters. We are particularly concerned that many small island developing States have not achieved sustained high levels of economic growth, owing in part to their vulnerabilities to the ongoing negative impacts of environmental challenges and external economic and financial shocks.
5. We acknowledge that for all countries the principle of national ownership is central to our common pursuit of sustainable development. We renew our commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as necessary to achieve sustainable development in all its dimensions.
6. We recognize that small island developing States continue to grapple with the effects of disasters.
7. We remain especially concerned about the devastating impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, slow-onset events and the increasing frequency, scale and intensity of disasters, due to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States.
8. We highlight the synergies between the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement and note with concern the scientific findings contained in the special report entitled Global Warming of 1.5°C of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
9. We recognize the need to strengthen international development cooperation and to address the recent declining trend of official development assistance.

10. We call upon the international community to mobilize additional development finance from all sources and at all levels to support small island developing States ' efforts.
11. We acknowledge the value of partnerships as a means of supporting the sustainable development of small island developing States and note the establishment of the Small Island Developing States Partnership Framework. We renew our commitment to working in meaningful partnerships with small island developing States.
12. We note the importance of oceans, seas and marine resources to small island developing States and acknowledge their efforts to develop and implement strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources. We reiterate the call made in the declaration entitled "Our ocean, our future: call for action"9 and encourage the fulfilment of voluntary commitments pledged in the context of the United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development and recall the decision to convene the 2020 Conference.
13. We emphasize the importance of the negotiations for an international legally binding instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction in line with resolution 72/249 of 24 December 2017.
14. We underscore the importance of eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty. Eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for small island developing States and other developing countries.
Progress, gaps and challenges
15. We recognize that gender equality and women's empowerment and the full realization of human rights for women and girls have a transformative and multiplier effect on sustainable development and are drivers of economic growth in small island developing States. Women can be powerful agents of change. We note and support ongoing efforts in small island developing States to achieve gender equality and women's empowerment, including economic empowerment, and full and equal participation and leadership and to end gender-based violence.
16. We note the advances in social inclusion by many small island developing States, but are concerned that poverty, unemployment, inequality and exclusion continue to disproportionately affect people in vulnerable situations.
17. We recognize the efforts of small island developing States in promoting peaceful, prosperous, inclusive societies and safe communities on their paths toward sustainable development.
18. We recognize the need for the prevention, detection and treatment of communicable and non-communicable diseases. We are concerned that these diseases and the health-related impact from disasters are endangering the delivery of quality and accessible health care in small island developing States.
19. We recognize that small island developing States face significant challenges in accessing sufficient affordable financing for sustainable development, including concessional financing, as their incomes grow. We also recognize the need to devise

methodologies to better account for the complex and diverse realities of middle income countries as outlined in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.
20. We remain committed to assisting small island developing States to further explore innovative financial instruments and mechanisms, such as debt for development swaps, debt for climate adaptation swaps, blue or green bonds among others, while remaining mindful of the need to ease debt burdens with a view to improving small island developing States' access to finance.
21. We reaffirm that successful engagement in international trade is a key driver for sustainable economic growth and sustainable development. We are concerned that small island developing States continue to face challenges in engaging in the multilateral trading system.
22. We acknowledge that remittances represent a major source of external financing in many small island developing States. We are concerned that they still face significant obstacles to the flow of and access to remittances, including costs, policies and access to correspondent banking relationships and services.
23. We recognize and are concerned by the transition challenges encountered by small island developing States that have graduated or are about to graduate from le ast developed country status. We remain mindful that graduation must not disrupt a country's development progress. We stress the need for the development and implementation of a viable multiannual transition strategy to facilitate each small island developing State's graduation, with the support of the international community where appropriate, to mitigate against, inter alia, the possible loss of concessionary financing, to reduce the risks of falling heavily into debt and to ensure macrofinancial stability.
24. We stress the importance of access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for small island developing States. We welcome all initiatives, such as the International Renewable Energy Agency and SIDS DOCK, to support small island developing States to fully exploit their renewable energy potential, improve energy efficiency and reduce dependence on imported sources of energy, noting the role of appropriate energy sources and technologies in the energy mix, and call for further work and enhanced support.
25. We commend the ongoing efforts made by small island developing States to make improvements to their transportation connectivity. We recognize the important role of sustainable transportation in promoting policy synergies, trade facilitation, infrastructure connectivity, financial cooperation and people -to-people exchange, which are key areas in achieving sustainable development.
26. We recognize that disaster risk reduction is key to advancing sustainable development, in all its dimensions, and resilient societies and note that many small island developing States still experience severe disaster repercussions, including, inter alia, significant loss of life, biodiversity and infrastructure destruction, disaster induced human mobility and threats to food security and nutrition.
27. We also recognize the diverse approaches to address climate change, inter alia ecosystem-based approaches, as part of overall adaptation, disaster risk reduction and resilience strategies for small island developing States, in the face of the adverse effects of climate change.
28. We reiterate the need for improved data collection and statistical analysis, including high-quality and disaggregated data, to enable small island developing States to better plan, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Samoa Pathway, the 2030 Agenda and the Sendai Framework monitor.
